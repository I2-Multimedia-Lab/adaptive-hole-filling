# adaptive-hole-filling
## Purpose
This project aims at filling the holes caused by occlusion in virtual views. In this project, we implemented an improved GMM and FDC to get more stable backgrounds, which are used for hole filling.
Besides, we adopted an adaptive hole-filling method to adaptively fill the holes in virtual views with the GMM and FDC backgrounds.
